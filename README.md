# Sample Splunk App Development Apps 

For the broken hearted ....

## Docker

``docker docker docker``

This repository includes a docker compose. For each sample app, simply start the service associated with it.

For example: ``docker-compose up -d tabbedcontent`` will start and mount the ``simple_xml_tabs`` sample app and start Splunk using the password in the compose file. You can change this if you wish, and these should not be used in production.
